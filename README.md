# Catapult (BRANCH: PART-1) #

https://gist.github.com/dradford/bc7734953071bbaf7357174e4f36554e


This repository has three branches and a master branch. The outcome is in the master branch.

*You are currently in the branch for part 1.*

The reason for splitting parts was to hopefully aid in evaluation -- since the challenge is split into parts, so will the solution, hopefully showing how each part evolves into the next.

I recommend running ```rake db:reset``` after each branch switch.
